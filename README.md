# Predicting-Heart-Disease

In this machine learning project, I have collected the dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci) and I will be using Machine Learning to predict whether any person is suffering from heart disease.

Here we will be experimenting with 3 algorithms 
1. KNeighborsClassifier
2. DecisionTreeClassifier
3. RandomForestClassifier
